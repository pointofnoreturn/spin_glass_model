We have 4 vertices, 6 edges,
2 spin variables, interaction energy 1.0
entailment energy 1000000.0, and temperature 20.0.
After 1000000 step(s), we have
0: + 0, edges from: 1 (w/ weight 0.04855313) 3 (w/ weight 0.00878993) 2 (w/ weight 0.04989156)
1: + -, edges from: 0 (w/ weight 0.02633373)
2: - 0, edges from: 3 (w/ weight 0.05719576)
3: + +, edges from: 2 (w/ weight 0.05536456)
and hamiltonian 999999.933215825
