To compile the simulation, execute the following Linux command:

make

Note: it makes use of Java libraries algs4.jar and stdlib.jar from http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar and http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/stdlib.jar respectively.

To run the simulation, execute the following Linux command:

./testAll.sh

To plot the data, use the Mathematica notebook titled "plotter.nb" and save the plots as images.
